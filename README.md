# Drug Induced Depression/Psychosis
I did Ecstasy (XTC, molly, mdma) three times over a three month range. It made me really sick: near psychosis state, depression, tired, anxiety and sometimes panic attacks.
That is how I saved myself and I am still regenerating. That was two years ago. Today I am a lot better and I present to you things that I did to save myself.

## Diet
- Eat plant based diet.
- No coffee, tea, sugar, sweets, salty, processed, foods.
- Eat a lot of vegetables. No fruits.
- In particular eat dark leafy vegetables.
- Be on a low *GI diet*.
- Drink only water.
- Make drinking milled chia seeds your breakfast daily routine.
- After eating don't drink anything for 3 hours.

Explanation:
- Plant based diet is the healthiest diet on the planet. It combats inflammation, depression and boosts autoimmunity. [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/)
- High glycemic carbs (sugar, white carbs, etc.) cause serotonin to be released in innatural fast way, that is not good when you did drugs and you are pretty much unstable. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8697046)
- Coffee, salts and processed foods make the blood pressure higher - avoid that.
- Milled chia seeds contain no carbs and they contain a lot of ALA (Omega-3 fatty acids) [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/?s=chia+seeds)
- Dark leafy vegetables help with depression [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression/).

Biased:
- No fruits - fruits are healthy [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-fruit-is-too-much/) but in this state I have found that sugar that is in them makes me more sick.
- Simillar situation with coffe, tea and salty, processed foods.
- Chia seeds - I have found that I don't feel good when my first meal contains carbs and I need some source of Omega-3. I think that light breakfast/dinner is the key to regenerate.
- Drink only clean water - everything that is in water is absorbed really fast so drinking after eating is not a good idea too.
- Diet is the key to regenerate.

## Exercise
- Exercise everyday/two days. [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/exercise-vs-drugs-for-depression/).
- Do not over exercise. Light exercise for 30-60 min. are okay.

Explanation:
- In this state your cortisol levels are a lot higher [Source](https://www.zrtlab.com/blog/archive/impact-hormones-serotonin-depression/), exercises elevates cortisol levels even more [Source](https://www.dnafit.com/us/advice/fitness/cortisol-stress-and-exercise.asp) so don't overdo it like me.
- You can not speed up this processes, exercising more can make you more sick.

Biased:
- I sometimes felt better after exercising.

## Supplements
- [Here, it is important](https://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/).
- DO NOT SUPPLEMENT MORE. 
- DO NOT EXPERIMENT WITH THINGS LIKE 5-HTP, Lion's mane shrooms, St. John's wort, Turmeric, etc.

Biased:
- DO NOT BE STUPID LIKE ME. YOU CAN NOT MAKE THIS PROCESS FASTER.
- About Antidepressants: there is no shame in taking them but if you don't have to: don't.
- Iodine, Selenium & Omega-3 supplements make me tired. Others for me are okay. You can get them in food (Algae, Chia seeds).
- I experimented a lot and found out that it is not worth it. It made me even more sick.

## Other tips (biased)
- Don't blame yourself. Trust yourself.
- Stick to family & friends. Don't isolate. Socialize if you can. It's okay if you can't.
- You will make a lot of mistakes but you will learn about yourself a lot.
- Get help! Psychologist?
- *Stress* is bad. Make everything you can to make you feel comfortable. This is very important. Stress will destroy you in one year in this state and you probably will be in this state for sometime. Trust me.
- You can have memory and thinking issues - it's okay, it will be better.
- Don't experiment, trust your body.
- It's okay to feel like shit.
- Sleep well (from 7 to 9 h).
- Don't push yourself too much.
- If you are not better after 6 months, try psychiatrist.
- Time, diet, exercise and love is the only medication.
- Love of the others can help you a lot.
- You will probably forget a lot of this, that's okay too.
