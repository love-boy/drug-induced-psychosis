# Drug Induced Depersonalization
I did Ecstasy (XTC, molly, mdma) three times over a three month range. It made me really sick: near psychosis state, depression, tired, anxiety and sometimes panic attacks.
I have managed to save myself and I am still regenerating. That was two years ago. Today I am a lot better and I present to you things that I did to be here, now.

## Diet
- Eat **plant based** diet.
- No coffee, tea, sugar, sweets, salty, processed, foods.
- Eat a lot of vegetables. No fruits.
- In particular eat dark leafy vegetables.
- Be on a low **GI diet**.
- Drink only water.
- Minimaze amount of carbohydrates on breakfast/supper (you can try e.g. chia seeds).
- After eating don't drink anything for 3 hours.

Explanation:
- Plant based diet is the healthiest diet on the planet. It combats inflammation, depression and boosts autoimmunity. [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-the-healthiest-diet/)
- High glycemic carbs (sugar, white carbs, etc.) cause serotonin to be released in innatural fast way which is not good when you did drugs and you are pretty much unstable. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8697046)
- Coffee, salts and processed foods make the blood pressure higher - avoid that.
- Milled chia seeds contain no carbs and they contain a lot of ALA (Omega-3 fatty acids) [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/?s=chia+seeds)
- Dark leafy vegetables help with depression [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/depression/).

Biased:
- No fruits - fruits are healthy [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-fruit-is-too-much/) but in this state I have found that sugar that is in them makes me more sick.
- Similar situation with coffee, tea and salty, processed foods.
- Chia seeds - I have found that I don't feel good when my first meal contains carbs and also I need some source of Omega-3. I think that light breakfast/dinner is the key to regenerate.
- Drink only clean water - everything that is in water is absorbed really fast so drinking after eating is not a good idea too. Water from plastic bottles is not necessarily clean.
- **Diet is the key to regenerate**.

## Exercise
- Exercise, ideally everyday/two days.
- Do not over exercise. Light exercise for 30-60 min. are great!

Explanation:
- Exercise are helpful when dealing with depression [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/exercise-vs-drugs-for-depression/).
- In this state your cortisol levels are a lot higher [Source](https://www.zrtlab.com/blog/archive/impact-hormones-serotonin-depression/), exercises elevates cortisol levels even more [Source](https://www.dnafit.com/us/advice/fitness/cortisol-stress-and-exercise.asp) so don't overdo it.
- You can not speed up this processes, exercising more can make you more sick.

## Supplements
- [Here, it is important](https://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/).
- DO NOT SUPPLEMENT MORE. 
- DO NOT EXPERIMENT WITH THINGS LIKE 5-HTP, Lion's mane shrooms, St. John's wort, Turmeric, etc.

Biased:
- About Antidepressants: there is no shame in taking them but if you don't have to: don't.
- Iodine, Selenium and Omega-3 supplements make me tired. B12, D3 supplements are ok. You can get the first three in food (Algae, Chia seeds).
- I experimented a lot and found out that it is not worth it.

## Air
- Air quality impacts our well-being [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/air-pollution/).
- If your city is polluted you can buy good pollution mask, indoor you can have air cleaner.
- Remember to ventilate your room, CO<sub>2</sub> levels impact your brain performance [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3114218).
- Fragrance (perfumes etc.) can be toxic [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9577937)

## Other tips (biased)
- Music can make you more unstable, it forces brain to stimulate but you need to cooldown, sorry.
- Don't blame yourself. Trust yourself.
- Stick to family and friends. Don't isolate. Socialize if you can. It's okay if you can't.
- You will make a lot of mistakes but you will learn about yourself a lot too.
- Get help! Psychologist, psychiatrist, even your aunt.
- **Stress** is bad. Make everything you can to make you feel comfortable. This is very important. Stress can and will destroy you. Trust me.
- You can have memory and thinking issues - it's okay, it will be better.
- Don't experiment, trust your body.
- It's okay to feel like shit.
- Sleep well (from 7 to 9 h).
- Don't push yourself too much.
- If you are not better after 6 months, try visiting psychiatrist.
- Time, diet, exercise, consistence and love is the only medication.
- Love of the others can help you a lot.
- You will probably forget a lot of this, that's okay too.
